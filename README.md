coreBOS module that supports a generic IFrame
=======

This module gives an easy way to embed any website inside our coreBOS CRM. It accepts one parameter which is the urlencoded URL of the website to load in the iframe. This parameter is called **load** so a typical call to this extension would look something like this:

``` http://your_server/your_corebos/index.php?module=cbifurl&action=index&load=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.corebos.org ```

The real powerful part of this extension is that you can use USER fields in the URL based on coreBOS email template syntax. So sending the current user's name and id to the website to load in the iframe would look something like this:

``` http://your_server/your_corebos/index.php?module=cbifurl&action=index&load=http%3A%2F%2Fserver%2Ffile.php%3Funame=$users-user_name$%26uid=$users-id$ ```

where **$users-user_name$** and **$users-id$** will get substituted accordingly.

This extension becomes very powerful in conjunction with some other extensions like the advanced menu where you can specify any link as a menu entry, on the Reportico and BIRT extensions where you can add direct links to the reports, ...

**secured used urls**
<ol>
<li>metabase

``` http://your_server/your_corebos/index.php?module=cbifurl&action=index&load=DASHBORD_NUMBER&embedtype=metabase&dashboard_url=DASHBOARD_URL&params={} ```
        **dashboard_url**,**params** should be encoded
</li>
<ol>


**Thank you** very much for your help and contribution.
